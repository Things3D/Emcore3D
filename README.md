# Emcore3D
The Emcore3D Framework is designed to be a fast, lightweight, optimized engine to render 3D objects, with augmented reality as one of its core components. It also extends to virtual reality, machine learning and multimedia playback. This makes the experience to develop this kind of content really accessible thanks to its easy to use controls and interaction capabilities. 

In order to use the framework in your own app you need to get a FREE development key here [www.emcore3d.com](https://www.emcore3d.com/).
